## Design


### Colour Scheme
![color pallet](assets/images/readmeimages/websitecolorpallet.png)

I wanted a cool and easy to read color scheme so I decided to go with a black background ,white text and gold accents for the colors as these colors contrast well together.

I created the pallet above to represent the colors used on the website [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:

* EB Garamond is used for headings on the site. 

* Roboto Slab is used for the body text on the site.

* serif was used as a backup incase the other two failed to load.

The reason I choose to use these fonts was because of the fact that they are easy to read and match other very well I also thought that they had a perfessonal vibe to that that suited Guilhermes young but business man personality.

### Accessibility

I adhered to all the recommended guidelines for accessibility. Here's what I implemented:

* Utilized semantic HTML for better structure and understanding.
* Included detailed alt attributes for images on the site.
* Added information for screen readers where images were used without accompanying text - for instance, I typed out the words in the image for the review.
* Ensured a sufficient color contrast across the site for better visibility.
* All links on the site are equipped with aria labels to provide clear instructions to screen readers.
