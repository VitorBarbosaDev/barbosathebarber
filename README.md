# Barbosa The Barber

![Multi_Display_Example](assets/images/readmeimages/readme_mutipledisplaysphoto.png)

The site was built to serve as a singular place where my brother, Guilherme, who is a barber, could promote his business. By consolidating all the information in one place, we hope to attract new customers.

Barbosa the Barber has been steadily growing on all his social media platforms, and with an increasing clientele comes less time to answer questions.

Hence why this site exists in order to help aid and reduce the amount of questions he gets asked on a daily basis.

#### Key information for the site

* Pictures of haircuts.
* How to book.
* Where is the shop.
* Open Hours.

* To make it easy for potential customers to find out the information they are seeking.
* To ensure the customer can find the information quickly.
* To allow potiental customers to have a hub where they can arrange their next haircut.
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* I want to find out who Barbosa the Barber is.
* I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information.
* I want to be able to find their social media profiles so I can see what their must recent cuts look like.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* I want to see if any new photos have been added to the gallery.
* I want to book another haircut.
* I want to find social media links.
#### Frequent Visitor Goals

## Design


### Colour Scheme
![color pallet](assets/images/readmeimages/websitecolorpallet.png)

I wanted a cool and easy to read color scheme so I decided to go with a black background ,white text and gold accents for the colors as these colors contrast well together.

I created the pallet above to represent the colors used on the website [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:

* EB Garamond is used for headings on the site. 

* Roboto Slab is used for the body text on the site.

* Serif was used as a backup incase the other two failed to load.

The reason I chose to use these fonts was because they are easy to read and complement each other very well. I also thought that they conveyed a professional vibe that suited Guilherme's youthful yet business-oriented personality.

## Features

The website consists of six pages, five of which can be accessed through the navigation menu. These include the Home, About, Services, Gallery, and Contact pages. The sixth page, a success page, is displayed once a user submits the form on the Contact page.

### All Pages on the website have:

A responsive navigation bar at the top, with the Barbosa The Barber logo positioned on the left and links to the different pages floated to the right. The currently selected page is highlighted with a gold underline to indicate the user's location on the site.

Additionally, every page includes a footer with two centrally placed social media links for TikTok and Instagram. The footer also carries the text "COPYRIGHT © VITOR BARBOSA" to denote the ownership of the website.


### Home Page.
* Hero Image Section: This section includes a hero image that covers the page. It also has a box in the right corner that contains a phrase.
* Why Cut with Me Section: This section has a centered H2 heading. It is then split into two; one side has an image of Guilherme standing, and the right side has a statement with a button to book underneath.
* Review Section: This section includes multiple images, each of them representing a different review.
* Tiktok Section: This section displays Guilherme's Tiktok feed.

#### About Page. 
* About me section.  This section is split into two. The left side features an image of Guilherme, while the right side contains a title and a statement.

#### Services Page. 
P Services We Offer section. This section contains a table that displays all the updated prices for each service that Guilherme offers as a barber.

#### Gallery Page.
* Pictures Section. This section is a collection of images which showcase different cuts.

#### Contact Page.
* Contact On Insta Section: This section, located on the left side of the page, contains a title and a paragraph. At the end of the paragraph, there's an Instagram button that will redirect the user to Guilherme's Instagram page.
* Barber Info Section: Next, we have a section that displays the location and operating hours of the barber. The location is shown using Google Maps, and the hours are presented in a table.
* Book Your Cut Section: Underneath everything, there's a form that allows the user to input their name, the type of haircut they want, and the day they want to get the haircut. Once they submit the form, they are redirected to the success page.

#### Success Page.
* This page is simiply a thank you message and then a button to go home 

#### Future Implementations.

* Use javascript to fetch the feed but written in my code so I have a bit more control over the styles and also what it is doing.
* Use javascript to hook up the form to some sort of service that will automacticly send an email to Guilherme telling him someone wants to book him.

### General features on each page

### Accessibility

I adhered to all the recommended guidelines for accessibility. Here's what I implemented:

* Utilized semantic HTML for better structure and understanding.
* Included detailed alt attributes for images on the site.
* Added information for screen readers where images were used without accompanying text - for instance, I typed out the words in the image for the review.
* Ensured a sufficient color contrast across the site for better visibility.
* All links on the site are equipped with aria labels to provide clear instructions to screen readers.
