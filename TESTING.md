From my understanding the reason why this page is slow is because of the maps and time it takes to load.

### WAVE
Wave was used to test the accessibility of each page 

#### Results for Index.html

#### Results for Contact.html
- [Wave for Contact](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact.png)

The Contact page had a contrast error related to the styling on the button. 
You can view the error in this image: [Wave Contact Page Contrast Error](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact-error.png).

Upon reviewing the results, I noticed that the contrast error occurred due to the white and gold color combination. Although it deviates from the recommended contrast standards, I personally find it visually appealing and believe it complements the overall style of the page. It's worth noting that all the other buttons feature a black background, white text, and a gold border.

Considering these factors, I have decided to maintain the current appearance of the button on the Contact page. However, I acknowledge the importance of being more attentive to color combinations in the future to ensure better accessibility and compliance with standards.

### Full Testing

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed full testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/TESTING.md#Full-Testing)

Full testing can be tedious, so it is great to try and break this part up into smaller chunks and do a bit at a time. Full testing is when you go through the site and test every single thing that can be tested. So for example you would test that all links in the navbar correctly redirect the user to where there are supposed to go. A table is the perfect way to display this information.
