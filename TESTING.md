From my understanding the reason why this page is slow is because of the maps and time it takes to load.

### WAVE
Wave was used to test the accessibility of each page 

#### Results for Index.html

#### Results for About.html
- [Wave for About](assets/images/testingimages/wave-about.png)

#### Results for Gallery.html

#### Results for Contact.html
- [Wave for Contact](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact.png)

The Contact page had a contrast error related to the styling on the button. 
You can view the error in this image: [Wave Contact Page Contrast Error](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact-error.png).

Upon reviewing the results, I noticed that the contrast error occurred due to the white and gold color combination. Although it deviates from the recommended contrast standards, I personally find it visually appealing and believe it complements the overall style of the page. It's worth noting that all the other buttons feature a black background, white text, and a gold border.

Considering these factors, I have decided to maintain the current appearance of the button on the Contact page. However, I acknowledge the importance of being more attentive to color combinations in the future to ensure better accessibility and compliance with standards.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

As far as I'm aware, there are currently no known bugs.


### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I resolved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The photo in the "Why Cut With Me" section had a lot of space on the right. | To fix this, I added a container on top of the image which allowed me to crop the right side of the image to look how I wanted it to. |
| 2 | The format of the "About" page kept breaking between 752 - 500px. | In order to fix this, I needed to add additional media queries and adjusted the format for these resolutions. |
| 3 | The format of the "Contact" page kept breaking between 1550px - 1200px. | In order to fix this, I needed to add additional media queries and adjusted the format for these resolutions. |
| 4 | The header was causing certain pages to have a horizontal scroll. | In order to fix this, I needed to remove the padding that was present as this, combined with width:100%, was causing errors as the header would take up a bit more room than what it should. I also added a margin:0 auto; to then center the logo in the middle of the page. |
