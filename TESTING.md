From my understanding the reason why this page is slow is because of the maps and time it takes to load.

### WAVE
Wave was used to test the accessibility of each page 

#### Results for Index.html

#### Results for About.html
- [Wave for About](assets/images/testingimages/wave-about.png)

#### Results for Services.html

#### Results for Gallery.html

#### Results for Contact.html
- [Wave for Contact](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact.png)

The Contact page had a contrast error related to the styling on the button. 
You can view the error in this image: [Wave Contact Page Contrast Error](assets/images/testingimages/wave-contact-error.png).

Upon reviewing the results, I noticed that the contrast error occurred due to the white and gold color combination. Although it deviates from the recommended contrast standards, I personally find it visually appealing and believe it complements the overall style of the page. It's worth noting that all the other buttons feature a black background, white text, and a gold border.

Considering these factors, I have decided to maintain the current appearance of the button on the Contact page. However, I acknowledge the importance of being more attentive to color combinations in the future to ensure better accessibility and compliance with standards.
